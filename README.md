![box preview](https://github.com/Tropicao/calaos-thermostat-box/blob/master/box_preview.png)  
## What does this repository contains
This repository contains two design files to generate a nice box for a Calaos :
* the main box design
* the box cover design
* a little spacer piece to avoid too heavy constraints between hat and RPI (must
  be placed under terminal block of hat and over HDMI on RPI)
server based on Raspberry Pi + Calaos Thermostat.

[Calaos](https://calaos.fr/en/) is an open source home automation server software.
[Calaos Thermostat Hat](https://github.com/calaos/calaos_thermostat_hw) is a hardware project to be able to pilot a gaz heater. The hat is designed to be plugged over a Raspberry Pi running Calaos server.

## How to use those design files
This enclosure has been designed with [Freecad](https://www.freecadweb.org/), an open source CAO modeler. The repository contains the source files (.fcstd format) to be able to open, edit and generate new designs based on this one.
You can then export those files to appropriate format (e.g. .stl format) in order to print it with a 3D printer.
